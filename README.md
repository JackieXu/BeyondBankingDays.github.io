## How your code is evaluated

1. Your code will be evaluated against 10 guidelines for building future-proof code. The guidelines are described in full in [“Building Maintainable Software”](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049555.do) (get your free copy during the event)

2. Find a concise reference card of the guidelines [here](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*TS-ZTeI7sQS7dy_AlMqSXQ.png)

3. You can check your code against the guidelines using Better Code Hub, a [GitHub.com](https://Github.com) integration provided by [Software Improvement Group SIG](https://www.sig.eu). Better Code Hub integrates with the GitHub Flow and can run at Pull Requests and Commits.

4. 16 modern programming languages are [supported](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/configuration-manual) with a maximum of 100 KLoc per code base.


## How to get started

1. Mail your team name and personal GitHub handles to [bettercodehub@sig.eu](mailto:bettercodehub@sig.eu) to get Pro access for private repo's

2. Put your public or private repo on Github in your profile

3. Go to [bettercodehub.com](https://bettercodehub.com) 

4. get instant feedback on the guidelines and pick refactor candidates



## How to get support
